# Free Online Basic Calculator

Perform everyday arithmetic quickly and accurately. Add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers with proper order of operations (PEMDAS). No downloads, no sign-ups—just open and calculate.

## How It Works

Enter numbers and operators using the on-screen keypad or your keyboard. The calculator evaluates expressions following standard mathematical order:

1. Parentheses first
2. Exponents (powers)
3. Multiplication and Division (left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (left to right)

Press equals or hit Enter to see your result.

## What You Can Do

- Basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Use parentheses to control calculation order
- Chain multiple operations in a single expression
- View and reuse your calculation history
- Copy results to clipboard

## Real-World Examples

**Splitting a restaurant bill:**
`(87.50 + 15.00) / 4` = 25.625

**Calculating a tip:**
`65.00 * 0.18` = 11.70

**Figuring out unit price:**
`24.99 / 12` = 2.0825

**Budgeting monthly expenses:**
`1200 + 450 + 89.99 + 150` = 1889.99

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Forgetting order of operations:**
`2 + 3 * 4` equals 14, not 20. Multiplication happens before addition. Use parentheses if you want `(2 + 3) * 4` = 20.

**Division by zero:**
Any number divided by zero is undefined. The calculator will show an error.

**Misplaced decimal points:**
Double-check decimal placement. `10.5 * 2` is very different from `105 * 2`.
