# Calculation History

CalcPro automatically saves every calculation you perform. Your history appears in the right panel and stays visible by default so you can reference previous results without extra clicks.

## Why History Stays Visible

Most calculator apps hide your history until you ask for it. CalcPro keeps it visible because:

- You often need to reference a previous result
- Comparing multiple calculations is easier when you can see them
- Re-running a calculation should take one click, not three

If you prefer a cleaner view, you can collapse the history panel anytime.

## What Gets Saved

Each history entry includes:

- **The expression you entered** — Exactly as you typed it
- **The result** — Calculated value
- **Calculator mode** — Which mode was active (Basic, Scientific, etc.)
- **Timestamp** — When you performed the calculation

History persists between sessions. Close your browser, come back tomorrow, and your calculations are still there.

## Using Your History

### Re-run a Calculation
Click any history entry to load it into the calculator. The expression appears in the input field, ready to edit or recalculate.

### Copy a Result
Click the copy icon next to any entry to copy the result to your clipboard. Useful for pasting into documents, spreadsheets, or other applications.

### Delete an Entry
Click the X on any entry to remove it from history. This action cannot be undone.

### Search History
Use the search box at the top of the history panel to find past calculations. Search matches against both expressions and results.

## Pinning Important Results

Some calculations matter more than others. Pin them to keep them accessible.

### How to Pin
Click the bookmark icon on any history entry. Pinned entries move to the top of the list and stay there.

### Why Pin?
- Reference values you use repeatedly
- Keep important results visible while working
- Prevent accidental deletion of critical calculations

### Unpinning
Click the bookmark icon again to unpin. The entry returns to its chronological position in history.

## Showing and Hiding History

### Collapse the Panel
Click the history toggle button (or the panel edge) to collapse the history panel. The calculator expands to fill the space.

### Expand the Panel
Click the toggle again to restore the history panel.

### Keyboard Shortcut
Press `H` to toggle history visibility quickly.

Your preference is saved. If you collapse history, it stays collapsed next time you visit.

## History and Privacy

Your calculation history is stored locally in your browser. It never leaves your device.

- No server stores your calculations
- No one else can see your history
- Clearing browser data removes history completely

For more details, see our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

## Managing History

### Clear All History
Open Settings and click "Clear History" to delete all saved calculations. Pinned entries are also removed.

### Automatic Limits
History stores your most recent calculations. Very old entries may be removed automatically to prevent storage issues. Pinned entries are never automatically removed.

## Tips for Effective Use

**Pin reference values**
Working with a specific constant or conversion factor? Pin it so you don't have to recalculate.

**Use search for complex expressions**
Can't remember exactly what you calculated last week? Search for part of the expression or result.

**Re-run and modify**
Click a history entry, modify the expression, and calculate again. Faster than typing from scratch.

**Keep history visible during work sessions**
When doing related calculations, visible history helps you track your work and catch mistakes.
