# Privacy Policy

CalcPro is built with privacy as a core principle. Your calculations are yours alone.

## How CalcPro Works

Every calculation happens entirely in your browser. When you type `2 + 2` and press Enter, your browser does the math. No server is involved. No data leaves your device.

This isn't a privacy feature we added. It's how the calculator is built.

## What Stays on Your Device

**Calculation history**
Your past calculations are stored in your browser's local storage. This data exists only on your device. If you clear your browser data, your history is deleted.

**Settings and preferences**
Your chosen calculator mode, angle settings (degrees/radians), precision preferences, and layout choices are saved locally. These persist between sessions so you don't have to reconfigure each time.

**Pinned results**
When you pin a calculation, it's saved in local storage alongside your history.

## What We Don't Do

**We don't send calculations to servers.**
There is no backend that processes your math. The calculator runs entirely in your browser using JavaScript.

**We don't track what you calculate.**
No analytics service sees your expressions or results. We have no way to know what you're calculating.

**We don't store your data remotely.**
There are no user accounts. No cloud sync. No database of calculations. Your data exists only in your browser.

**We don't use tracking cookies.**
CalcPro doesn't use cookies for tracking or advertising purposes.

## What We Do Store

CalcPro uses your browser's local storage to save:

| Data | Purpose | Location |
|------|---------|----------|
| Calculation history | Let you review and reuse past calculations | Browser local storage |
| Pinned results | Keep important calculations accessible | Browser local storage |
| Settings | Remember your preferences | Browser local storage |
| Mode selection | Open to your last-used calculator | Browser local storage |

All of this data is stored locally on your device. We cannot access it.

## Clearing Your Data

You control your data completely.

**Clear everything:**
Open Settings in CalcPro and click "Clear All Data." This removes your history, pins, and preferences.

**Clear through browser:**
Clearing your browser's local storage or site data for CalcPro removes all stored information.

**Use private browsing:**
In incognito or private mode, nothing persists after you close the window.

## Offline Use

CalcPro works offline after you load it once. This is possible because:

1. The entire calculator runs in your browser
2. No server communication is required for calculations
3. Your history is stored locally, not in the cloud

If you're offline, everything works exactly the same.

## Third-Party Services

CalcPro does not integrate with third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

The only external resources are:

- **Fonts:** Standard web fonts loaded from CDN (no tracking)
- **Hosting:** Static file hosting (standard web server logs only)

## Children's Privacy

CalcPro doesn't collect personal information from anyone, including children. There are no accounts, no forms to fill out, and no data collection.

## Changes to This Policy

If we change how CalcPro handles data, we'll update this page. The calculator's core privacy model—local-only processing with no server communication—is fundamental to how it works and won't change.

## Questions

If you have questions about privacy, you can reach us through the contact information on our website.

**Summary:** CalcPro runs entirely in your browser. Your calculations never leave your device. Your history is stored locally and can be cleared anytime. We don't track you.
