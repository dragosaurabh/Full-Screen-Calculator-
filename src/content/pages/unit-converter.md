## Temperature Conversions

Temperature conversions aren't simple multiplications:

**Celsius to Fahrenheit:**
°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32

**Fahrenheit to Celsius:**
°C = (°F - 32) × 5/9

**Celsius to Kelvin:**
K = °C + 273.15

**Reference points:**
| Description | °C | °F | K |
|-------------|-----|-----|-----|
| Water freezes | 0 | 32 | 273.15 |
| Room temperature | 20 | 68 | 293.15 |
| Body temperature | 37 | 98.6 | 310.15 |
| Water boils | 100 | 212 | 373.15 |

## Volume Conversions

| From | To | Multiply by |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Liters | Gallons (US) | 0.264172 |
| Milliliters | Fluid Ounces | 0.033814 |
| Cubic Meters | Liters | 1000 |
| Cups | Milliliters | 236.588 |

**Common conversions:**
- 1 gallon (US) = 3.785 liters
- 1 liter = 33.81 fl oz
- 1 cup = 237 mL

**Note:** US and UK gallons differ. 1 UK gallon = 1.201 US gallons.

## Area Conversions

| From | To | Multiply by |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Square Meters | Square Feet | 10.7639 |
| Hectares | Acres | 2.47105 |
| Square Kilometers | Square Miles | 0.386102 |

**Common conversions:**
- 1 acre = 4,047 m² = 0.405 hectares
- 1 hectare = 10,000 m²
- 1 square mile = 640 acres

## Speed Conversions

| From | To | Multiply by |
|------|-----|-------------|
| km/h | mph | 0.621371 |
| m/s | km/h | 3.6 |
| Knots | km/h | 1.852 |

**Common conversions:**
- 100 km/h = 62.14 mph
- 60 mph = 96.56 km/h
- 1 knot = 1.151 mph

## Data Storage Conversions

| Unit | Bytes |
|------|-------|
| 1 KB (Kilobyte) | 1,024 |
| 1 MB (Megabyte) | 1,048,576 |
| 1 GB (Gigabyte) | 1,073,741,824 |
| 1 TB (Terabyte) | 1,099,511,627,776 |

**Bits vs Bytes:**
- 1 byte = 8 bits
- Internet speeds often use bits (Mbps)
- Storage uses bytes (GB)
- 100 Mbps = 12.5 MB/s

## Time Conversions

| From | To | Value |
|------|-----|-------|
| 1 minute | seconds | 60 |
| 1 hour | minutes | 60 |
| 1 day | hours | 24 |
| 1 week | days | 7 |
| 1 year | days | 365.25 |

## Real-World Examples

**Cooking:**
Recipe calls for 2 cups of flour:
2 × 236.588 = 473 mL

**Travel:**
Speed limit is 65 mph, your car shows km/h:
65 × 1.609 = 104.6 km/h

**Fitness:**
Lost 5 kg, how many pounds?
5 × 2.205 = 11.02 lb

**Weather:**
Forecast says 30°C:
(30 × 9/5) + 32 = 86°F

**File download:**
100 Mbps connection, 4 GB file:
4 GB = 32 Gb
32,000 Mb ÷ 100 Mbps = 320 seconds ≈ 5.3 minutes

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Confusing US and UK units:**
US gallon ≠ UK gallon. US ton ≠ metric ton. Always check which system.

**Forgetting temperature offset:**
0°C ≠ 0°F. Temperature conversions have an offset, not just a ratio.

**Mixing up bits and bytes:**
Internet speeds use bits (Mbps). Storage uses bytes (MB). Divide by 8 to convert.

**Square and cubic conversions:**
1 meter = 3.281 feet, but 1 m² = 10.76 ft² (squared), and 1 m³ = 35.31 ft³ (cubed).

## FAQ

**Why are there different gallon sizes?**
The US gallon (3.785 L) and UK/Imperial gallon (4.546 L) evolved from different historical standards.

**Is a metric ton the same as a ton?**
No. A metric ton (tonne) = 1,000 kg. A US ton = 2,000 lb ≈ 907 kg. A UK ton = 2,240 lb ≈ 1,016 kg.

**How do I convert square units?**
Square the linear conversion factor. Since 1 m = 3.281 ft, then 1 m² = 3.281² = 10.76 ft².

**What's the difference between KB and KiB?**
KB (kilobyte) sometimes means 1,000 bytes (SI) and sometimes 1,024 bytes (binary). KiB (kibibyte) always means 1,024 bytes. This calculator uses binary (1 KB = 1,024 bytes).

**Can I convert currencies?**
Yes. The converter includes major currencies with rates that can be updated. Note that exchange rates fluctuate.

**How accurate are these conversions?**
Conversions use standard factors accurate to at least 6 significant figures. For scientific work, verify precision requirements.
